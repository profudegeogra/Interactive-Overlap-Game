# Interactive-Overlap-Game
This interactive mini-project uses CSS animations and JavaScript collision detection to visualize animals moving toward their food. When they overlap, a checkmark appears along with a descriptive sentence. Made for fun and learning!
Demo Preview
Click the "Start overlap" button and watch the animals move!

Each animal will animate toward its food. When they reach it, you'll see a ✔️ and a description.

🧠 How It Works
Each pair (animal + food) is wrapped in a .pair container.

On clicking the Start overlap button, animals animate using unique CSS keyframes.

JavaScript continuously checks for collision between .animal and .food.

On collision, it shows:

A green checkmark ✔️

A line of text (e.g. "Lupul mănâncă oaia")

🛠️ Technologies Used
